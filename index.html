        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>1 I have always been interested in technology and understanding how things work. From a young age I took things apart to see how they worked. When my first computer broke i didn't have the money to repair it so i looked up online how to fix it myself. I discovered the wrong cable was being used to power the gpu, which was causing crashes on high load. since then I have learned to build and upgrade desktop computers and have built and repaired many of my friends and families computers. when my friends computer was crashing under load I tested each component for faults to see if there were problems with the hardware and eventually began to suspect his psu. I got a psu testing device found that there was a fault with the part. After replacing the psu his pc worked flawlessly.
            I decided to start the code nation course because i had a vast knowledge of PC hardware and fault finding. But my knowledge of how computer software is made was fairly limited. I wanted to know how to create bespoke programs and possibly start a career in software development.

        <h1>IT in a modern buisness</h1>
        <p>IT is the backbone of modern business being used to process, store and transport information. IT is vital for a modern business to keep up with the competition as online stores and one day delivery become more prevalent and data needs to be shared near instantly across workspaces in most large companies.
            customer data can be accessed by support staff so when a customer has an issues their data can be instantly accessed allowing staff to make appropriate decisions based on the individual customer. This also means if a customer has an ongoing problem they don't need to explain the issue to multiple people, once it is on file the staff can instantly see the history of the problem. Also if a customer has an enquiry about an order or product the member of staff can instantly access the relevant details.
            It is vital for managing inventory to ensure that stock is meeting customer demand without buying more than is necessary. Companies with perishable goods make massive losses when stock is either too low or too high due to wasted product. IT can track the number of stock using digital pos systems as well as analysing sales to predict required stock. This information can then be shared across all departments.
            large filing cabinets are no longer required as servers or storage devices take up less room and can be accessed anywhere on their network. companies can store large amounts of data using only a small amount of physical space and have the data readily available to anyone who needs it.
            large amounts of data can be processed via computers to organise them in an efficient manner. Then they can be analysed to identify patterns and trends to make accurate predictions.

        <h1>methods, skills and reasorces.</h1>
        <p>planning is vital to success in any project as it is always important to have clear goals and milestones to ensure your work is contributing to the final product. It ensures that deadlines are met by giving timeframes of each stage of the project. It is important to have a clear image of what the final product will look like to ensure that each prior stage is contributing to the overall goal. planning can also stop problems such as feature creep as the features will be decided before development starts. If the project involves a group creating a plan ensures that everyone is working to their strengths and that each member understands their role and what other members of the group are doing.
            Communication is vital to a successful project weather its with team members or the client it is important to ensure that you and your team have all the relevant information.
            the web is an incredibly valuable resource for digital products providing a vast amount of information on any given challenge or concept. code sharing sites such as git hub can be good for finding solutions to problems or to find inspiration. communication apps such as slack are vital for group work to allow members to easily communicate over distance and to send each other resources. planning software such as trello is very useful for creating a list of tasks required for a team to accomplish and allowing members to see where the group is up to as a whole. other team members are a resource that shouldn't be overlooked and can be a good source of ideas and can provide advice on aspects they are more familiar with.

        <h1>Website</h1>
        <P>To plan my website I will first find out the deadline and plan around that time frame. I will then find out the appropriate skills I will need for the project and find resources that will help me learn these skills. I will create a trello board of all the stages of development to ensure I have a clear goal at each stage of development.
            I will decide on the content of the site considering my target audience. the site will be a portfolio of my work, so I will need to add relevant videos and images and leave opportunity to add more work in the future. I will structure the website in a way that is easy to understand and allows pages to be easily added.
        </P>

        <h1>risks of digital project </h1>
        <p>Poor time management can cause a digital project to miss deadlines possibly causing the project to fail. projects can fail due to overestimating your ability to implement certain features leaving the final product incompleat. Not planning for features or new content that will come after launch could cause complications down the line when you come to update the website or add new content.
            lack of communication can cause serious problems due to team members not understanding their role. if team members are not properly communicating they could end up making different versions of the same feature wasting time or create incompatible features.
        </p>
        
        <div>  
        <h1>selecting IT systems and software</h1>
        <p>When selecting new software i would think of what software I am familiar with that would also be suited to the project to ensure that time is not wasted learning new software when current knowledge would suffice. I would enquire what other members of the team are using to ensure that everyone is using compatible software such as all using the same communication software to make sharing information faster. I would also ensure that the team members working on the same feature where using the same coding language and file type.
            Using a variety of operating systems and devices for testing to ensure that the product is compatible with most devices the user may have. this includes testing on mobile devices to ensure they are compatible with the site. I would also test the sight in multiple aspect ratios and resolutions to ensure it is compatible with a wide range. I would test the site on multiple web browsers to ensure the popular ones are compatible.
            I would use trello to plan the stages of development and ensure the development of my sight is broken down into smaller achievable goals. I would use draw.io to create a flow diagram for the paths on the site and how the user will navigate.
            I will code the site using html and css as they are required by web browsers.
            
        </p>
        <div>
          
         <div>
        <h1>analysis of chosen technologies</h1>
        <p>Trello would allow me to break up the project into smaller manageable tasks. this ensures that at each stage of development I can see what needs to be done next and will ensure time is spent efficiently. Draw.io would allow me to plan the paths for the website and allow me to have a clear vision of user navigation.
            gitHub can help with version control allowing me to keep track of changes I make to my code. each git file has a history, allowing me to see the code at each previous stage of development. gitHub can also allow other users to review your code and make comments making pier review easier.

         <p>The companies act 2006 requires that you disclose information about the identity of your company on your website. This does not have to be on every page but it must be easily accessible such as being on the bottom of the main page or on a contact us page.
            The GDPR regulations require preferences on your websites contact forms to be no or blank by default and to have the user have to manually opt in to be contacted. forms should collect the minimum information possible and only information required for the task at hand. Users must be notified that cookies are being used to track their behavior. It also requires you to have a data breach process if data is stolen.

        <h1>Content and layout</h1>
        <P>Each page will have a navigation bar at the top of the page that will allow the user to
            find any other page. the home page will contain an introduction to who I am and what
            I can do. It will also have some examples of my best work.I will have contact
            information page containing my email address.I will have multiple display pages
            dedicated to different types of work. Such as coding other projects.
            The site will have a dark theme to make it easier on the eyes.
            </P>
        <h1>coppyright and other constraints</h1>
        <P>The site will need to follow copyright guidelines meaning all of its content must be
            owned by the site owner or they must have permission to use the copyrighted

            if it meets the international WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standard.
            </P>

        <h1>Accses issues</h1>
        <P>A help section could be included for users who find the site confusing. The site could
            be auto translated by google but in the future it might be more effective to have the
            site accessible in other languages, especially if dealing with forign clients. The site
            could have a text size increase mode for people with poor eyesight. The site could
            have an easy access mode for disabled people, with bigger buttons to make mouse
            accuracy a lesser issue. The site will not use sound at launch so hearing impairment
            should not be an issue for the foreseeable future.
            </P>

        <h1>File types</h1>
        <p>The file types i will be using are .html for the backend of the website , .css for the front end of the website. For images i will use .jpeg for stil images and .gif when motion is required. I will use .py files when i want to show off my coding skill with python.

    <h2> Review of site</h2>
    <h1>2.1</h1>
    <p>Trello has been verry usefull for managing my time and keeping track of the tasks that i need to get done. I have been using trello columns for, to do, doing and done to keep track of where each feature is in development and to see what to work on next after a feature is complete. Trello was easy to understand and i found it to be the best tool  that I am aware of for the task. Visual studio code Was very helpfull with managing my files and being able to quickily swich between editing my html and my css. visual studio was also good for speeding up my coding as it auto added some parts of the code such as adding end taggs. I liked that visual studio provided me with lots of information as a created my code such as showing me line number and hilighting indentation. I enjoyed using visual studio and would use it again in future projects. The website codepen was usefull for alowing me to eddit my code from home and from another computer when my laptops batery died. Code pen was easy to understand and alowed me to see all my code on the same page with the result at the bottom alowng me to see live changes without having to move to another tab.

    </p>
    <h1>2.2</h1>
    <p>Visual studio code was verry efective at editing the code for the website as it alowed me to efortlesly switch between files. This meant that i could make changes to the backend using html then instanly switch to my css file and make visual changes on the front end of the site. Visual studio allso allowed me to easily see whitch files had errors and what line they where on. visual studio code was definatley the apropriate software to eddit the sites code.

        Trello was ideal for tracking my progres through the project and alowed me to easily understand what tasks needed to be compleated. trello alowed me to create tasks that had easy to read titles and more detailed descriptions. trello allso alowed me to make comments under each task to remind my self where im up to with a certain task. 
        
        codepen alowed me to quickly add code to the site and then eddit it when i got home alowing me to eddit it on another computer without transfering files or downloading software. This was perticularly usefull when my laptop ran out of power and when i wanted to continue working from my home computer. 
        
        chrome and fire fox where ideal for testing my site as they are widly used web browsers.
        </p>
    <h1>2.3</h1>
    <p>The strength of my final product is that it is easy to understand as the content is on 1 page and only requires that the user can scroll through the content.  the site uses dark colours ensuring eye streign is minalised when reading the content. The font of my website looks profesional and is easy to read. I have embeded my python game within the site that alows the user to play the game and see my work within their web browser rather than having to download python.

        The weaknesses of my site are that it looks vsualy unapealing as there are no images and the colours are bland. The content is all on the same page makeing it not all fit under the same catagory posibly causing confusion. The text it as wide as the window at all times posibly making it hard to read on larger monitors or at higher resolutions. the site has no navigation options besides scrolling and users may expect more than one page.
        
        I am not happy with the final version of the site and if given time in the future i will work to implament the features that i have mentiond prior. although i am not happy with the product i have learned some valuable lessons from its creation.
        </p>
    <h1>2.4</h1>
    <p>If i had more tine i would have created more pages to catogarise the content and split it into easily digestable chunks rather than one large page of text with content that is not all related to a single purpose. With multiple pages added I would have implomented a navigation bar to ensure the user could seamlesly navigate between pages. I would make the text have tighter columns to make it easier to read and to improve the astetic of the site. I would add images to make the site look more apealing and posibly convey information that words cant convey as efectively sucn as a portrait and some pictures of work. 


    </p>
    <h1>2.5</h1>
    <p>I have looked over all the outcomes to ensure i have answered them and have given them clear titles on the site to ensure the user understands what the paragraphs are refeing to.

    </p>
    <h1>3.1</h1>
    <p>The productivity benefits of using visual studio code where being able to see all the files asosiated with the project and seamlesly switch between editing the front and back end of the site. visual studio code allso increased productivety by adding the ends to taggs automaticaly. visual studio was fast at identifying errors as it showed which file had the errors and where they where located with a red line.  Trello increased my efficiency as i was constantly aware of each task and never had to stop to think of the next step. codepen increased my productivity as it alowed me to work from home without spending time moving files and downloading software.

    </p>
    <h1>3.2</h1>
    <p>Productivity could be increased by timing each task to ensure that every minute is being acounted for. Un official deadlines could be used for each section of the project to ensure time is not wasted obsessing over one feature while others are bing neglected. focusing on one task at a time to ensure each task has been given the required amount of atention. tasks could be prioritised and a minimum viable product could be concived to ensure that there will be a working product on the deadline.

    </p>
    <h1>3.3</h1>
    <p>It could have been more effcient if i had prior knolage of how to create a website. The main time constraint was learning how to implament each feature and i am sure that if i atempted a similar project it would be developed much faster.The sites creation could allso have been sped up by working in a group alowing the html css and text content to be created at the same time. 
    </p>

    <h1>3.4</h1>
    <P>When testing digital solutions i would work with a diverse team to increase the probability of someone finding an error. this includes things like using people who are less fluent with technology to find parts of a solution that might be confusing for some people. I would test the solution on multiple types of hardware such as on diferent computer specs, laptops and desktops, mobile divices and anything elce a user may try to use the software on. for web based products i would test the product on all the popular web browsers to test for incompatabilities.
